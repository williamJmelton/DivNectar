# Installing tools and themes


<a id="org176fe63"></a>

We&rsquo;re going to make KDE look as much like MacOS Big Sur as we can! It&rsquo;s quite a journey, so let&rsquo;s get started.

## Getting Prepared ðŸ’ª

We&rsquo;re going to need to download a tool called pacaur that allows us to download and install packages from the AUR (Arch User Repository). Then we&rsquo;ll use that to automatically download the theme packages from github and let the pacaur manager handle the install for us. You could also just visit the theme&rsquo;s github pages, clone them and then run the install script. If you really wanted too ðŸ¤”

## Let&rsquo;s Start Changing Things

### Changing the General Theme

-   Open your settings application and navigate to Apperance < Global Theme and select the WhiteSur Theme, and apply it.
-   Next, click the application style option and select the Kvantum style and apply it.
-   At the bottom of that screen, is a button that says Configure Gnome/GTK App Style, click that and then choose the WhiteSur theme and apply that as well.

### Now we&rsquo;ve gotten somewhere!

Our system is already looking alot like MacOs! A few things aren&rsquo;t right though. We need a dock, and the bar that is at the top of a Mac, with the global app menu. So let&rsquo;s do that now.

### Moving Our Panel

1.  Right click the panel on the desktop and click edit panel, and click the position button and drag it on up to the top of the screen.
2.  Click the add widgets button, and search for &ldquo;global menu&rdquo;, add it right next to the app launcher icon.
3.  Hover your mouse over the icon task manager and click remove.
4.  press the super key (cmd key or win key) and type latte dock to launch it - it&rsquo;s pretty much configured out of the box. I like to hide the background.
    
    There we go, that looks much more mac-like now.

### Other Small Things

You&rsquo;ll notice now a few things are still out of place. I&rsquo;ll post a few fixes I know here:

1.  Firefox global menu doesn&rsquo;t work
    -   You need to install the firefox-appmenu-bin from the AUR (using pacaur) and that will work.
2.  The Terminal is Ugly
    -   Yeah it is. Fuck. I just clicked configure profile in Konsole and searched for a good light theme, and then reduced the opacity on it a little. Looks great.
3.  Fonts look like trash
